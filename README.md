# RealEstateRework
This is the last programming project of my OpenClassrooms formation. It's an app to manage real estates. It uses one REST API that don't respond as I chose to stop it, because of potential risks in price as it were on my own money. (Google maps)
My implementation of the MVVM pattern needs to be reworked, I should have used Databinding to use it to its best.
It uses the Material Design as much as possible, without animations as it weren't supported on my local emulator.
